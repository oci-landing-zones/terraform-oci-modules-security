# 1. Rename this file to <project-name>.auto.tfvars, where <project-name> is a name of your choice.
# 2. Provide values for "Tenancy Connectivity Variables".
# 3. Replace <REPLACE-BY-REPORTING-REGION-NAME> placeholder by the reporting region name. Example: "us-ashburn-1".
# 4. Replace <REPLACE-BY-SECURITY-ZONE-COMPARTMENT-REFERENCE> placeholder by the appropriate security zone compartment reference, 
#    expected to be found in the OCI Object Storage object referred by <REPLACE-BY-OBJECT-NAME>.
# 5. Replace <REPLACE-BY-SECURITY-ZONE-RECIPE-COMPARTMENT-REFERENCE> placeholders by the appropriate security zone recipe compartment references, 
#    expected to be found in the OCI Object Storage object referred by <REPLACE-BY-OBJECT-NAME>.
# 6. Replace <REPLACE-BY-BUCKET-NAME> placeholder by the OCI Object Storage bucket that contains the object referred by <REPLACE-BY-OBJECT-NAME>.
# 7. Replace <REPLACE-BY-OBJECT-NAME> placeholder by the OCI Object Storage object that has the compartment references. This object is supposedly 
#    stored in OCI Object Storage by the module that manages compartments.
