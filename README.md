# OCI Landing Zone Security Modules

![Landing Zone logo](./landing_zone_300.png)

Welcome to the [OCI Landing Zones (OLZ) Community](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones)! OCI Landing Zones simplify onboarding and running on OCI by providing design guidance, best practices, and pre-configured Terraform deployment templates for various architectures and use cases. These enable customers to easily provision a secure tenancy foundation in the cloud along with all required services, and reliably scale as workloads expand.

This repository contains Terraform OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) modules for security services that help customers align their OCI implementations with the CIS (Center for Internet Security) OCI Foundations Benchmark recommendations.

The following modules are available:
- [Bastion Service](./bastion/)
- [Cloud Guard](./cloud-guard/)
- [Security Zones](./security-zones/)
- [Vaults](./vaults/) (a.k.a KMS)
- [Vulnerability Scanning](./vss/)

Within each module you find an *examples* folder. Each example is a fully runnable Terraform configuration that you can quickly test and put to use by modifying the input data according to your own needs.  

## CIS OCI Foundations Benchmark Modules Collection

This repository is part of a broader collection of repositories containing modules that help customers align their OCI implementations with the CIS OCI Foundations Benchmark recommendations:
- [Identity & Access Management](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-cis-landing-zone-iam)
- [Networking](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-cis-landing-zone-networking)
- [Governance](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-cis-landing-zone-governance)
- [Security](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-cis-landing-zone-security) - current repository
- [Observability & Monitoring](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-cis-landing-zone-observability)
- [Secure Workloads](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-secure-workloads)

The modules in this collection are designed for flexibility, are straightforward to use, and enforce CIS OCI Foundations Benchmark recommendations when possible.

Using these modules does not require a user extensive knowledge of Terraform or OCI resource types usage. Users declare a JSON object describing the OCI resources according to each moduleâ€™s specification and minimal Terraform code to invoke the modules. The modules generate outputs that can be consumed by other modules as inputs, allowing for the creation of independently managed operational stacks to automate your entire OCI infrastructure.
